## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a sophisticated, next-generation AI agent framework built entirely in JavaScript, designed to empower developers to create intelligent, autonomous, and highly scalable systems. Building upon the foundational concepts of AI agents, this 2.0 iteration focuses on modularity, extensibility, and real-world applicability for automating complex workflows, processing information, and interacting dynamically with various data sources and APIs.

Whether you're looking to build intelligent bots, automated data processors, proactive monitoring systems, or intricate decision-making engines, AI-Agent-2.0 provides a robust, event-driven architecture that simplifies the development and deployment of intelligent agents. This repository also includes a ready-to-use web interface, demonstrating how to interact with and visualize the agent's capabilities.

## Features

AI-Agent-2.0 comes packed with powerful features to streamline your AI agent development:

*   **Modular Agent Architecture:** Design agents with clear responsibilities using a highly modular structure, making your code organized, maintainable, and scalable.
*   **Task Automation Engine:** Define and execute complex, multi-step tasks programmatically, enabling seamless automation of routine or intricate operations.
*   **Dynamic API Integration:** Easily connect and interact with external services, databases, and third-party APIs through configurable connectors and plugins.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making (Rules Engine):** Implement sophisticated decision-making logic using a flexible rules engine that allows agents to react intelligently to various inputs and states.
*   **Event-Driven Core:** A robust event bus allows agents to communicate, trigger actions, and react to system events in real-time, fostering a highly responsive environment.
*   **Extensible Plugin System:** Extend the agent's capabilities by developing custom plugins or "skills" that can be easily integrated, allowing for limitless possibilities.
*   **State Management:** Built-in mechanisms for persistent and volatile state management, enabling agents to remember context and learn over time.
*   **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Integrated logging capabilities to track agent activity, debug issues, and monitor performance effectively.
*   **Configurable & Flexible:** Easily configure agent behaviors, task definitions, and integrations through intuitive configuration files.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Fully leverages JavaScript's asynchronous nature (`async/await`) for non-blocking operations, ensuring high performance and responsiveness.
*   **Integrated Web Interface:** A frontend application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction and visualization of agent activities.
*   **Netlify Deployment Ready:** Configured for seamless deployment on Netlify, including serverless functions for backend interactions.

## Installation

To get AI-Agent-2.0 up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables (if any):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example` (if provided) and populate it with your specific configurations (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
    ```
    # Example .env content (adjust as needed)
    API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE=your_api_key_here
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start defining and running your intelligent agents.

### Starting the Agent Core

The core agent system (backend) can be launched directly:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

This will typically initialize the agent framework and load any pre-configured agents or tasks.

### Accessing the Web Interface

After starting the agent core (if needed locally, or if deployed to Netlify), you can open `index.html` in your browser for the web interface, or navigate to your deployed Netlify site. The `js/api.js` and `netlify/functions/call-ai.js` files facilitate communication between the frontend and the AI agent core (or other external AI services).

### Defining Your First Agent

Agents are typically defined as modular components that contain a set of `tasks` or `skills`.

Let's create a simple agent that performs a basic operation:

1.  Create a new file, e.g., `src/agents/MyFirstAgent.js`:

    ```javascript
    // src/agents/MyFirstAgent.js
    const { Agent } = require('../core/Agent'); // Assuming a core Agent class

    class MyFirstAgent extends Agent {
        constructor() {
            super('MyFirstAgent'); // Unique name for your agent
            this.description = "A simple agent that greets and logs a message.";

            // Register tasks/skills for this agent
            this.registerTask('greetUser', this.greetUser);
            this.registerTask('logMessage', this.logMessage);
        }

        async greetUser(params) {
            const { name = 'Guest' } = params;
            this.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to AI-Agent-2.0.`);
            return { success: true, message: `Greeted ${name}` };
        }

        async logMessage(params) {
            const { message } = params;
            if (!message) {
                this.logError("LogMessage task requires a 'message' parameter.");
                return { success: false, error: "Message parameter missing." };
            }
            this.log(`Agent received message: "${message}"`);
            return { success: true, loggedMessage: message };
        }
    }

    module.exports = MyFirstAgent;
    ```

2.  Ensure your main application entry point (e.g., `src/index.js` or `app.js`) registers this agent:

    ```javascript
    // src/index.js (simplified example)
    const AgentCore = require('./core/AgentCore'); // The main agent orchestrator
    const MyFirstAgent = require('./agents/MyFirstAgent');

    async function initializeAgents() {
        const core = new AgentCore();

        // Register your custom agents
        core.registerAgent(new MyFirstAgent());

        // Start the core agent system
        await core.start();
        console.log('AI-Agent-2.0 Core initialized and running.');

        // --- Example of triggering tasks ---

        // Execute a task from MyFirstAgent
        console.log('\n--- Executing greetUser task ---');
        const greetResult = await core.executeTask('MyFirstAgent', 'greetUser', { name: 'Developer' });
        console.log('Greet Result:', greetResult);

        console.log('\n--- Executing logMessage task ---');
        const logResult = await core.executeTask('MyFirstAgent', 'logMessage', { message: 'This is a test log entry.' });
        console.log('Log Result:', logResult);

        console.log('\n--- Attempting logMessage without required parameter ---');
        const errorResult = await core.executeTask('MyFirstAgent', 'logMessage', {});
        console.log('Error Result:', errorResult);
    }

    initializeAgents().catch(console.error);
    ```

This example demonstrates the core concept: defining agents with tasks and using the `AgentCore` to orchestrate and execute them. Explore the `src/examples` directory (if it exists) for more advanced use cases, and `js/main.js` for how the frontend might interact.

## Configuration

AI-Agent-2.0 supports flexible configuration to adapt to your needs.

*   **Environment Variables (`.env`):** Sensitive information like API keys, database URLs, etc., should be stored here.
*   **`config/` directory:** This directory typically holds various configuration files (e.g., `agents.json`, `services.json`, `settings.js`) that define agent loading paths, service integrations, and other operational parameters for the AI agent framework.
*   **`netlify.toml`:** Configuration for Netlify deployment, including build settings and serverless function paths.

Refer to the `config/` folder and `src/config/index.js` (or similar) for details on how the system loads and uses these configurations.
