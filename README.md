Okay, as an expert technical writer, I'll craft a high-quality `README.md` for `AI-Agent-2.0`. Given the sparse initial data, I will infer a robust, modular, and developer-friendly JavaScript framework for building autonomous AI agents, leveraging the "2.0" to imply advancements in flexibility and capability.

## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a cutting-edge, JavaScript-based framework designed for building intelligent, autonomous agents with unparalleled flexibility and power. Building upon the foundational concepts of AI agents, version 2.0 introduces a highly modular and extensible architecture, empowering developers to create sophisticated agents capable of perceiving complex environments, making informed decisions, and executing a wide array of tasks.

Whether you're developing intelligent automation bots, interactive AI companions, smart monitoring systems, or dynamic game characters, `AI-Agent-2.0` provides the robust, developer-friendly toolkit you need to bring your intelligent systems to life. Its design emphasizes ease of use, performance, and scalability, making it suitable for both rapid prototyping and production-grade applications.

## Features

`AI-Agent-2.0` comes packed with a set of powerful features designed to simplify the development of intelligent agents:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily compose agents from distinct, interchangeable modules (Sensors, Effectors, Decision Engines, State Managers).
*   **Perception Engine:** Define custom `Sensor` modules to enable agents to perceive and interpret data from diverse environments (e.g., APIs, file systems, real-time streams, user input).
*   **Decision Making Core:** Implement sophisticated `DecisionEngine` logic to allow agents to process perceptions, internal state, and external goals to determine the optimal course of action.
*   **Action & Effectors:** Equip agents with `Effector` modules to execute actions within their environment (e.g., send requests, update databases, control hardware, interact with UIs).
*   **Persistent State Management:** Built-in `AgentState` management allows agents to maintain memory and learn from past experiences, enabling more complex behaviors over time.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** Agents communicate internally and externally through a robust event system, promoting loose coupling and reactive behaviors.
*   **Node.js Compatible:** Seamlessly integrate `AI-Agent-2.0` into any Node.js application, from backend services to CLI tools.
*   **Developer-Friendly API:** A clean, intuitive API reduces the learning curve and accelerates development.
*   **Scalable & Performant:** Designed with asynchronous operations and efficiency in mind, ensuring your agents can handle demanding workloads.
*   **Extensible by Design:** Easily extend core classes or create entirely new module types to fit unique requirements.

## Installation

To get started with `AI-Agent-2.0`, ensure you have Node.js (v14.x or higher) and npm (or Yarn) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the demo (Optional):**
    After installation, you can run a simple example agent to see the framework in action.
    ```bash
    npm run demo
    # or
    yarn demo
    ```
    This will typically start a basic agent that showcases perception, decision, and action cycles.

## Usage

Building an AI agent with `AI-Agent-2.0` involves defining your agent's components: Sensors to perceive, Effectors to act, and a Decision Engine to reason.

Here's a basic example of an agent that periodically checks the time and decides whether to "log" or "alert" based on its observations:

First, let's assume `ai-agent-2.0` is published to NPM. If you're working directly from the cloned repository, you might need to adjust imports or build the package first.

```javascript
// src/simpleAgent.js
import { Agent, Sensor, Effector, DecisionEngine } from 'ai-agent-2.0'; // Replace with actual package name or relative path

/**
 * Custom Sensor: Perceives the current time and a random "activity level".
 */
class TimeActivitySensor extends Sensor {
    constructor() {
        super('TimeActivitySensor');
    }

    async perceive() {
        const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        const activityLevel = Math.random() < 0.3 ? 'low' : (Math.random() < 0.7 ? 'medium' : 'high');
        console.log(`[${this.name}] Perceived: Time=${currentTime}, Activity=${activityLevel}`);
        return { currentTime, activityLevel };
    }
}

/**
 * Custom Effector: Executes actions like logging or sending alerts.
 */
class ConsoleEffector extends Effector {
    constructor() {
        super('ConsoleEffector');
    }

    async execute(action) {
        console.log(`[${this.name}] Executing action: ${action.type}`, action.payload);
        if (action.type === 'LOG_TIME') {
            console.log(`    -> Logged current time: ${action.payload.time}`);
        } else if (action.type === 'ALERT_HIGH_ACTIVITY') {
            console.warn(`    -> !!! ALERT: High activity detected at ${action.payload.time} !!!`);
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Custom Decision Engine: Decides what action to take based on perception.
 */
class ActivityDecisionEngine extends DecisionEngine {
    constructor() {
        super('ActivityDecisionEngine');
    }

    async decide(perception, agentState) {
        // Log current perception and state (for debugging)
        // console.log(`[${this.name}] Deciding based on perception:`, perception);
        // console.log(`[${this.name}] Current agent state:`, agentState.get());

        if (perception.activityLevel === 'high') {
            return {
                type: 'ALERT_HIGH_ACTIVITY',
                payload: { time: perception.currentTime }
            };
        } else {
            return {
                type: 'LOG_TIME',
                payload: { time: perception.currentTime }
            };
        }
    }
}

async function main() {
    // 1. Create a new Agent instance
    const myAgent = new Agent('TimeMonitoringAgent');

    // 2. Add sensors to perceive the environment
    myAgent.addSensor(new TimeActivitySensor());

    // 3. Add effectors to perform actions
    myAgent.addEffector(new ConsoleEffector());

    // 4. Set the decision engine for intelligent behavior
    myAgent.setDecisionEngine(new ActivityDecisionEngine());

    // 5. Start the agent's perception-decision-action loop
    console.log('Starting TimeMonitoringAgent...');
    // The agent will perceive, decide, and act every 3000ms (3 seconds)
    myAgent.start(3000);

    // Optional: Stop the agent after a certain period for demonstration
    setTimeout(() => {
        myAgent.stop();
        console.log('TimeMonitoringAgent stopped.');
    }, 15000); // Run for 15 seconds
}

main();
```

To run this example:

1.  Save the code above as `src/simpleAgent.js` in your cloned repository.
2.  Open your terminal in the repository's root directory.
3.  Run the agent:
    ```bash
    node src/simpleAgent.js
    ```
    You will see the agent's perception, decision, and action cycles in the console.

### Building Your Own Agent

1.  **Define your `Sensor`s:** Extend the `Sensor` class to define how your agent perceives data from its environment.
2.  **Define your `Effector`s:** Extend the `Effector` class to define the actions your agent can perform.
3.  **Implement your `DecisionEngine`:** Extend the `DecisionEngine` class and implement the `decide(perception, agentState)` method. This is where your agent's core logic resides.
4.  **Instantiate `Agent`:** Create an `Agent` instance and add your custom sensors, effectors, and set your decision engine.
5.  **Start the Loop:** Call `agent.start(intervalMs)` to begin the agent's perception-decision-action cycle.

For more complex examples and detailed API documentation, please refer to the `docs/` directory (placeholder, but good to mention for future).
