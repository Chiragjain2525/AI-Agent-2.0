As an expert technical writer, I understand the importance of a clear, comprehensive, and engaging `README.md`. Even with minimal initial data, we can infer and construct a high-quality document that anticipates user needs and provides a strong first impression.

Given "No description provided," I will infer the purpose of "AI-Agent-2.0" as a robust framework for building intelligent agents in JavaScript, focusing on common functionalities expected from such a system.

## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a robust, intelligent, and extensible JavaScript-based framework designed for developing **autonomous AI agents**. Building upon the foundational concepts of AI automation, this 2.0 iteration provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for creating agents capable of complex decision-making, task execution, and seamless interaction with various APIs and services.

Whether you're looking to automate workflows, build intelligent assistants, or explore advanced AI applications, AI-Agent-2.0 offers a structured and efficient way to bring your intelligent agents to life. It emphasizes modularity, ease of use, and scalability, allowing developers to focus on agent logic rather than boilerplate.

---

## Features

âœ¨ AI-Agent-2.0 comes packed with capabilities to empower your intelligent applications:

*   **Modular Agent Architecture:** Easily define and manage agent behaviors, tasks, and sub-agents.
*   **Contextual Memory Management:** Agents can maintain and leverage conversational history and past interactions to inform future actions.
*   **Dynamic Task Orchestration:** Define complex sequences of actions and allow agents to adapt to new information.
*   **Pluggable Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with external APIs, services, and custom tools (e.g., web search, databases, specific APIs like OpenAI, Google, etc.).
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Built for performance and responsiveness, handling multiple tasks concurrently.
*   **Event-Driven System:** Agents can react to internal and external events, enabling highly responsive behaviors.
*   **Extensible & Customizable:** Designed for easy extension with custom behaviors, tools, and decision-making models.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Mechanisms to manage and recover from unexpected scenarios during agent execution.
*   **Configurable Persistence:** Options for saving and loading agent states and memories.

## Installation

To get AI-Agent-2.0 up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
*   **npm** or **Yarn**: Latest stable version.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

---

## Configuration

AI-Agent-2.0 relies on a `.env` file for sensitive information like API keys and a `config.js` (or similar) file for general settings.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Duplicate the `.env.example` file in the root directory and rename it to `.env`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit your `.env` file:**
    Populate it with your API keys and other sensitive credentials.
    ```env
    # .env example
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here
    # Add other API keys as needed (e.g., GOOGLE_API_KEY, CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY)
    ```

3.  **Review `src/config/config.js` (or similar):**
    This file typically holds general configuration settings for the agent, such as default models, memory settings, and logging levels. Adjust these as per your project's requirements.

    ```javascript
    // src/config/config.js (Example structure)
    module.exports = {
        agentName: "MySmartAgent",
        defaultModel: "gpt-4-turbo",
        memory: {
            type: "file", // or 'redis', 'database'
            path: "./agent_memory.json"
        },
        logging: {
            level: "info" // 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error'
        },
        // ...other settings
    };
    ```

---

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can start building and running your AI agents.

### Basic Agent Creation

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to define and run an agent that responds to a prompt:

1.  **Create a new agent file** (e.g., `src/agents/simpleAgent.js`):

    ```javascript
    // src/agents/simpleAgent.js
    const { Agent } = require('../core/Agent'); // Adjust path as per your project structure
    const config = require('../config/config');

    async function runSimpleAgent() {
        const agent = new Agent({
            name: config.agentName,
            model: config.defaultModel,
            initialPrompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Your goal is to provide concise and accurate answers.",
            tools: [] // Add tools here if your agent needs them
        });

        console.log(`Agent '${agent.name}' is online. Initializing...`);

        try {
            const response = await agent.run("What is the capital of France?");
            console.log("Agent's Response:", response);

            const followUp = await agent.run("And what is its population?");
            console.log("Agent's Follow-up Response:", followUp);

            // You can also interact with the agent in a chat-like loop
            // await agent.chatLoop();

        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Agent encountered an error:", error);
        }
    }

    module.exports = runSimpleAgent;
    ```

2.  **Run the agent from your main entry point** (e.g., `index.js` or `app.js`):

    ```javascript
    // index.js
    require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables first
    const runSimpleAgent = require('./src/agents/simpleAgent');

    async function main() {
        console.log("Starting AI-Agent-2.0 application...");
        await runSimpleAgent();
        console.log("Application finished.");
    }

    main().catch(console.error);
    ```

3.  **Execute the main script:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

This will output the agent's response to the console. Explore the `src/core/` and `src/agents/` directories for more advanced examples and agent definitions.

### Building Complex Agents

AI-Agent-2.0 facilitates the creation of sophisticated agents by:

*   **Defining Custom Tools:** Implement new functions for your agent to use (e.g., `webSearchTool.js`, `databaseQueryTool.js`).
*   **Chaining Behaviors:** Create workflows where one agent's output feeds into another's input.
*   **Integrating Memory Types:** Swap out file-based memory for Redis or a database for persistent, scalable memory.
*   **Developing Sub-Agents:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks handled by specialized sub-agents.

Refer to the `examples/` directory (if present in the actual repository) for more detailed use cases and advanced configurations.
