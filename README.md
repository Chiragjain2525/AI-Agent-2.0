## The Foundational Framework for Autonomous Intelligent Systems

`AI-Agent-2.0` is not just a framework; it's a **paradigm shift** in how we build, deploy, and scale intelligent automation. Crafted with JavaScript and Node.js, this cutting-edge platform empowers developers to transcend traditional scripting, enabling the creation of truly robust, intelligent, and autonomous agents that can learn, adapt, and make data-driven decisions in dynamic, real-world environments.

This 2.0 iteration is meticulously engineered for **extensibility, performance, and unparalleled ease of use**. We've focused on abstracting away the complexities of agent orchestration, asynchronous communication, and tool integration, making advanced AI agent development more accessible and efficient than ever before. Whether your ambition is to automate sophisticated business processes, develop context-aware smart assistants, orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows, or build resilient AI-driven services, `AI-Agent-2.0` provides the foundational architecture and comprehensive toolset to bring your most ambitious intelligent systems to life.

## ✨ Core Features & Innovations

`AI-Agent-2.0` stands out with a suite of powerful features designed for the next generation of AI development:

*   **Modular & Composable Architecture:** Build agents with a "plug-and-play" system. Easily integrate, extend, and customize agent behaviors, tools (functions, APIs), memory modules, and decision-making capabilities. This promotes reusability and maintainability.
*   **Event-Driven Core for Real-time Responsiveness:** At its heart, `AI-Agent-2.0` leverages a robust event emitter and listener pattern, enabling agents to react to internal states, external stimuli, or inter-agent communications in real-time. This is crucial for dynamic environments and complex interactions.
*   **Seamless Pluggable Tools & Skills:** Empower your agents with capabilities by integrating virtually any external API, custom function, or third-party service as a "tool." Agents can autonomously discover, select, and utilize these tools to achieve their goals.
*   **Advanced Context & State Management:** Beyond simple memory, `AI-Agent-2.0` provides sophisticated mechanisms to manage agent context, long-term state, and episodic memory. This enables agents to maintain coherence across interactions, learn from past experiences, and perform more complex, multi-step reasoning.

## 💡 Usage & Getting Started

Here's a foundational example demonstrating how to initialize and run a simple `AI-Agent-2.0` agent. This snippet illustrates the core concepts of agent creation, tool definition, and basic execution flow.

Let's create a file named `index.js`:

```javascript
// In a real AI-Agent-2.0 project, you would import core classes directly:
// const { Agent, Tool, ContextManager, EventBus } = require('ai-agent-2.0');
// For this standalone example, we'll simulate the essential components.

/**
 * Represents a tool that an Agent can use.
 */
class Tool {
    constructor(name, description, executeFn) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        this.execute = executeFn;
    }
}

/**
 * Simplified Context Management for the Agent.
 */
class ContextManager {
    constructor() {
        this.context = new Map();
    }

    set(key, value) {
        this.context.set(key, value);
        console.log(`[Context] Updated: ${key} = ${JSON.stringify(value)}`);
    }

    get(key) {
        return this.context.get(key);
    }

    getAll() {
        return Object.fromEntries(this.context);
    }
}

/**
 * The core Agent class in its simplified form.
 */
class Agent {
    constructor({ name, description, tools = [], capabilities = {} }) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        this.tools = new Map(tools.map(tool => [tool.name, tool]));
        this.capabilities = capabilities;
        this.context = new ContextManager(); // Use our simplified ContextManager
        console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" initialized. Description: "${this.description}"`);
    }

    /**
     * Agent uses a specified tool.
     * @param {string} toolName - The name of the tool to use.
     * @param {...any} args - Arguments to pass to the tool's execute function.
     */
    async useTool(toolName, ...args) {
        const tool = this.tools.get(toolName);
        if (!tool) {
            throw new Error(`Tool "${toolName}" not found for agent "${this.name}".`);
        }
        console.log(`[${this.name}] Using tool "${toolName}" with args: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        try {
            const result = await tool.execute(...args);
            this.context.set(`last_tool_result_${toolName}`, result);
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`[${this.name}] Error executing tool "${toolName}": ${error.message}`);
            this.context.set(`last_tool_error_${toolName}`, error.message);
            throw error;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Simulates the agent's decision-making process.
     * In a full AI-Agent-2.0, this would integrate with LLMs, rule engines, or custom logic.
     * @param {string} prompt - The input prompt for the agent to consider.
     * @returns {object} An object describing the next action (e.g., useTool, respond).
     */
    async think(prompt) {
        console.log(`\n[${this.name}] Thinking about: "${prompt}"...`);
        // Simulate complex thinking, possibly involving an LLM call
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 800));

        this.context.set("current_prompt", prompt);

        if (prompt.includes("greet")) {
            return { action: "useTool", tool: "greet", args: ["AI-Agent-2.0 User"] };
        } else if (prompt.includes("task") || prompt.includes("automate")) {
            return { action: "useTool", tool: "performComplexTask", args: ["data analysis and reporting"] };
        } else if (prompt.includes("status")) {
            return { action: "respond", message: "My current status is operational and awaiting instructions." };
        }
        return { action: "respond", message: "I'm still learning how to handle that request. Please provide more clarity." };
    }

    /**
     * Executes a full cycle of the agent's operation.
     * @param {string} initialPrompt - The starting instruction or query.
     */
    async run(initialPrompt) {
        console.log(`\n--- ${this.name} Initiates Run ---`);
        this.context.set("run_start_time", new Date().toISOString());

        try {
            const thought = await this.think(initialPrompt);

            if (thought.action === "useTool") {
                const toolResult = await this.useTool(thought.tool, ...thought.args);
                console.log(`[${this.name}] Tool "${thought.tool}" executed successfully. Result: "${toolResult}"`);
                this.context.set("last_successful_action", { tool: thought.tool, result: toolResult });
            } else if (thought.action === "respond") {
                console.log(`[${this.name}] Responds: "${thought.message}"`);
                this.context.set("last_response", thought.message);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`[${this.name}] An error occurred during run: ${error.message}`);
            this.context.set("run_error", error.message);
        } finally {
            this.context.set("run_end_time", new Date().toISOString());
            console.log(`\n--- ${this.name} Run Finished ---`);
            console.log("Final Agent Context:", this.context.getAll());
        }
    }
}

// 1. Define Example Tools: These are the "skills" your agent can call upon.
const greetTool = new Tool(
    "greet",
    "Greets a specified person or entity.",
    (name) => `Hello, ${name}! Your AI Agent is ready to assist you.`
);

const performComplexTaskTool = new Tool(
    "performComplexTask",
    "Simulates performing a detailed, time-consuming background task.",
    async (taskDescription) => {
        console.log(`  [Tool: ${performComplexTaskTool.name}] Starting task: "${taskDescription}"...`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // Simulate work
        return `Task "${taskDescription}" completed successfully. Report generated.`;
    }
);

// 2. Initialize the Agent: Give it a name, description, and the tools it possesses.
const masterAgent = new Agent({
    name: "NexusBot",
    description: "An advanced AI agent capable of intelligent interaction and complex task orchestration.",
    tools: [greetTool, performComplexTaskTool],
    capabilities: {
        canCommunicate: true,
        canLearn: true, // Placeholder for future learning capabilities
        canOrchestrate: true
    }
});

// 3. Demonstrate Agent Capabilities by running it with different prompts.
async function demonstrateAgentWorkflow() {
    await masterAgent.run("I need a friendly greeting from NexusBot.");
    await masterAgent.run("Can you automate a data processing task for me?");
    await masterAgent.run("What is your current operational status?");
    await masterAgent.run("Tell me a joke."); // Agent won't have a tool for this yet, demonstrating fallback.
}

// Execute the demonstration
demonstrateAgentWorkflow().catch(console.error);
```

To run this example:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will output the agent's initialization, detailed thinking process, dynamic tool usage, and context updates, providing a clear demonstration of its fundamental capabilities.

**Note:** The `Agent`, `Tool`, and `ContextManager` classes in the `Usage` example are highly simplified for illustrative purposes. The actual `AI-Agent-2.0` framework offers a significantly more robust, feature-rich, and optimized implementation of these components, including advanced error handling, concurrency management, and integration points for external AI services. For more advanced examples and detailed API documentation, please refer to the `examples/` directory in the repository (once populated) and the official documentation.
