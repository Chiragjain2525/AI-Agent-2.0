## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a robust, modular, and extensible JavaScript framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of intelligent, autonomous AI agents. Building upon the foundational concepts of AI agents, version 2.0 introduces enhanced capabilities for task orchestration, intelligent decision-making, and seamless integration with modern AI models and external tools.

This project aims to empower developers to create sophisticated agents capable of understanding, reasoning, acting, and adapting within complex environments. Whether you're building personal assistants, automated workflows, or advanced research prototypes, AI-Agent-2.0 provides the essential architecture and tools to bring your intelligent agent ideas to life efficiently and effectively.

## Features

AI-Agent-2.0 is packed with features designed for flexibility and power:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend and customize agents with pluggable components for perception, memory, reasoning, and action execution.
*   **Task Orchestration:** Define and manage complex sequences of tasks, allowing agents to break down high-level goals into executable sub-tasks.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making:** Integrate custom reasoning engines or leverage external AI models (like Large Language Models) to enable agents to make informed decisions based on their current state and observations.
*   **State & Memory Management:** Robust mechanisms for agents to maintain internal state, remember past interactions, and store relevant information over time.
*   **Extensible Tooling:** Agents can be equipped with a wide array of tools (functions, APIs, external services) to interact with the environment or perform specific actions.
*   **Event-Driven Core:** A flexible event system allows agents to react asynchronously to internal states, external stimuli, or user input.
*   **Seamless AI Integration:** Designed for easy integration with various AI services and models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, custom ML models) for advanced natural language processing, image recognition, or predictive analytics.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Built from the ground up to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, ensuring agents remain responsive and non-blocking.

## Usage

This section provides a quick guide to getting started with `AI-Agent-2.0` by demonstrating how to create a simple agent and make it perform a basic task.

### Getting Started

Let's create an `EchoAgent` that can register a simple tool and respond to a message.

1.  **Create a new JavaScript file** (e.g., `myAgent.js`):

    ```javascript
    // myAgent.js
    import { Agent, Task } from './src/index.js'; // Adjust path if installed via npm: 'ai-agent-2.0'

    async function runEchoAgent() {
        console.log("Initializing EchoAgent...");

        // 1. Create a new Agent instance
        const echoAgent = new Agent({
            name: 'EchoAgent',
            description: 'A simple agent that can echo messages and perform basic greetings.'
        });

        // 2. Register a simple tool/capability for the agent
        echoAgent.registerTool({
            name: 'sayHello',
            description: 'Greets a person by their name.',
            parameters: {
                type: 'object',
                properties: {
                    name: { type: 'string', description: 'The name of the person to greet.' }
                },
                required: ['name']
            },
            execute: async ({ name }) => {
                return `Hello, ${name}! I am ${echoAgent.name}.`;
            }
        });

        // 3. Define a simple task for the agent to execute
        const greetingTask = new Task({
            name: 'greetSpecificUser',
            description: 'Task to greet a specific user using the sayHello tool.',
            execute: async (context) => {
                const userName = context.input || 'User'; // Use input or default
                const result = await echoAgent.tools.sayHello.execute({ name: userName });
                return result;
            }
        });

        echoAgent.addTask(greetingTask);

        // 4. Run the agent with a task
        console.log("\n--- Agent executing task ---");
        const greetingOutput = await echoAgent.runTask('greetSpecificUser', { input: 'Alice' });
        console.log(`Agent's response: ${greetingOutput}`); // Expected: "Hello, Alice! I am EchoAgent."

        // 5. Demonstrate direct tool invocation (for testing/specific scenarios)
        console.log("\n--- Agent directly invoking tool ---");
        const directGreetingOutput = await echoAgent.tools.sayHello.execute({ name: 'Bob' });
        console.log(`Direct tool response: ${directGreetingOutput}`); // Expected: "Hello, Bob! I am EchoAgent."

        console.log("\nEchoAgent finished its demonstration.");
    }

    runEchoAgent().catch(console.error);
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    node myAgent.js
    ```

### Expected Output:

```
Initializing EchoAgent...

--- Agent executing task ---
Agent's response: Hello, Alice! I am EchoAgent.

--- Agent directly invoking tool ---
Direct tool response: Hello, Bob! I am EchoAgent.

EchoAgent finished its demonstration.
```

This example demonstrates the basic flow of initializing an agent, registering a tool, defining a task, and then executing that task. For more advanced usage, explore defining custom perception modules, memory systems, and integrating with external AI services.

## Configuration

AI-Agent-2.0 supports various configuration options to tailor agent behavior and integrate with external services.

*   **Agent Options:** When initializing an `Agent` instance, you can pass an options object to configure its name, initial memory, and other core behaviors.
*   **Tool Configuration:** Tools can be configured with specific API keys, endpoints, or custom parameters required for their execution.
*   **External AI Service API Keys:** For integrating with services like OpenAI, you'll typically need to set environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) or pass them directly during service initialization.

Detailed configuration guides and examples will be provided in the `docs/` directory.
