## Description

`AI-Agent-2.0` is engineered to be a versatile and powerful autonomous agent. It leverages state-of-the-art AI models (such as large language models) to understand natural language instructions, break down complex goals into manageable sub-tasks, and execute them by interacting with a defined set of tools and APIs.

This version focuses on:

*   **Modularity:** Easily integrate new tools, memory systems, and planning algorithms.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a broader range of tasks and interactions.
*   **Robustness:** Improved error handling and context management for more reliable operation.
*   **Extensibility:** A clear API for developers to expand the agent's capabilities.

Whether you're looking to automate workflows, build intelligent assistants, or explore advanced AI applications, `AI-Agent-2.0` provides a solid foundation.

## Features

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Capable of understanding high-level goals and executing a sequence of steps to achieve them.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making:** Utilizes advanced planning and reasoning to select the most appropriate tools and actions.
*   **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with external APIs and services (e.g., web search, calculators, custom scripts).
*   **Context Management & Memory:** Maintains a coherent understanding of the ongoing task, remembering past interactions and outcomes.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Easy to swap out or add components like different LLM providers, toolkits, or memory modules.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Built on Node.js's non-blocking I/O for efficient handling of multiple tasks.
*   **Pluggable LLM Support:** Designed to work with various Large Language Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, custom endpoints).

## Installation

To get `AI-Agent-2.0` up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `AI-Agent-2.0` with the correct repository name if different.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys and other sensitive configurations. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

---

## Configuration

`AI-Agent-2.0` relies on environment variables for sensitive data like API keys and configurable settings. We recommend using a `.env` file at the root of your project.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

2.  **Add your environment variables:**
    Open the `.env` file and add the necessary variables. For example, if you're using OpenAI:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o" # or "gpt-3.5-turbo", etc.
    AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=10 # Optional: Max steps agent can take
    DEBUG_MODE=true # Optional: Enable detailed logging
    ```
    *Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.*

    **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in the `.gitignore` for your safety.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can run `AI-Agent-2.0` to start interacting with it.

### Running the Agent

You can initiate the agent via the command line.

```bash
npm start "Your initial task or goal here"
```

**Example:**

To ask the agent to perform a web search and summarize information:

```bash
npm start "Find out the current weather in London and summarize the forecast for the next 24 hours."
```

Or, for a more complex task:

```bash
npm start "Research the latest advancements in quantum computing, identify key researchers, and draft a short summary."
```

The agent will then print its thoughts, actions, and observations to the console as it attempts to achieve the given goal.

### Interactive Mode (Optional)

*(If your agent supports an interactive chat-like mode, you might add this section)*

To run the agent in an interactive chat mode where you can give it follow-up instructions:

```bash
npm run interactive
```

Then, type your prompts at the `> ` cursor.
