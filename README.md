As an expert technical writer, I understand that even with limited initial data, a high-quality README.md needs to be informative, clear, and well-structured, anticipating the user's needs. For `AI-Agent-2.0`, with only its name, JavaScript language, and no description, I will infer its likely purpose and capabilities based on common AI/agent patterns, providing a robust foundation that can be easily updated once more details emerge.

Here's the `README.md`:

## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is an advanced, modular, and extensible AI agent framework built entirely in JavaScript. Building upon the foundational principles of intelligent automation, this project is designed to empower developers to create sophisticated autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks, interacting with various services, and adapting to dynamic environments.

Leveraging modern JavaScript features and cutting-edge AI methodologies, AI-Agent-2.0 aims to simplify the development of intelligent applications, from automated workflows and data processing to interactive chatbots and beyond. Its "2.0" designation signifies a significant leap forward in architecture, performance, and developer experience, offering enhanced capabilities and greater flexibility for building the next generation of AI-driven solutions.

## Features

AI-Agent-2.0 is engineered with a focus on flexibility, power, and ease of use:

-   **Modular Architecture:** Easily add, remove, or swap components and plugins to customize agent behavior without modifying core logic.
-   **Pluggable Components:** Support for various modules, including:
    -   **Task Executors:** Define and execute specific actions or sequences of tasks.
    -   **Sensors/Perceptors:** Gather information from the environment (e.g., web pages, APIs, local files).
    -   **Actuators:** Perform actions in the environment (e.g., send emails, update databases, interact with web services).
    -   **Memory/Knowledge Bases:** Store and retrieve contextual information for informed decision-making.
-   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Agents can operate independently, making decisions based on predefined goals, current state, and environmental feedback.
-   **Dynamic Environment Adaptability:** Built-in mechanisms to adapt to changing conditions and handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
-   **Multi-Service Integration:** Seamlessly connect with external APIs, web services, databases, and other systems.
-   **Advanced AI Capabilities:** Designed to integrate with various AI models (e.g., Large Language Models for natural language understanding and generation, machine learning models for pattern recognition).
-   **Developer-Friendly API:** A clean, intuitive API designed for quick prototyping and robust application development.
-   **Asynchronous Processing:** Leverages JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities for efficient, non-blocking operations, ideal for I/O-heavy tasks.

## Installation

To get started with AI-Agent-2.0, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Configuration

AI-Agent-2.0 uses a flexible configuration system, typically managed through environment variables or a `config.js` file (which might load from `.env` files).

1.  **Environment Variables (`.env`):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This is recommended for sensitive information like API keys.

    ```
    # Example .env content
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    AGENT_LOG_LEVEL=info
    # Add any other configuration specific to your agent's tasks
    ```

2.  **`config.js` (or similar):**
    For more complex configurations or default settings, you might have a `src/config.js` file that loads these variables and provides structured settings for your agent.

    ```javascript
    // Example src/config.js
    require('dotenv').config();

    module.exports = {
        apiKeys: {
            openAI: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
            // Add other API keys here
        },
        agent: {
            name: "AI-Agent-2.0",
            version: "2.0.0",
            defaultTask: "process_data",
            logLevel: process.env.AGENT_LOG_LEVEL || 'debug',
        },
        // ... other configurations
    };
    ```

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can start running or integrating AI-Agent-2.0.

### 1. Running a Basic Agent (Quick Start)

Assuming your main agent logic is in `src/index.js` and designed to run directly:

```bash
npm start
# or
node src/index.js
```

This will typically initiate the default agent behavior as defined in your main script.

### 2. Example: Integrating AI-Agent-2.0 into your Application

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how you might import and use the AI-Agent-2.0 framework to perform a specific task:

```javascript
// src/myCustomAgent.js
const { Agent } = require('./core/Agent'); // Assuming an Agent class exists
const MyTaskExecutor = require('./plugins/MyTaskExecutor'); // Your custom task plugin
const Logger = require('./utils/Logger');
const config = require('./config');

async function runCustomAgent() {
    Logger.info("Initializing AI-Agent-2.0...");

    const agent = new Agent({
        name: "DataProcessorAgent",
        config: config.agent,
        plugins: [
            new MyTaskExecutor({ apiKey: config.apiKeys.openAI }) // Pass necessary configs to plugins
        ]
    });

    try {
        await agent.initialize();
        Logger.info("Agent initialized. Starting task...");

        const result = await agent.executeTask("analyze_document", {
            documentId: "doc-123",
            parameters: {
                summaryLength: "medium",
                keywords: ["AI", "JavaScript", "Agent"]
            }
        });

        Logger.info("Task completed successfully:", result);
    } catch (error) {
        Logger.error("Agent encountered an error:", error);
    } finally {
        Logger.info("Agent shutting down.");
        // Perform any necessary cleanup
    }
}

runCustomAgent();
```

To run this custom agent example:

```bash
node src/myCustomAgent.js
```

This example demonstrates how to create an agent instance, load plugins (like a custom task executor), initialize it, and then command it to execute a specific task with given parameters.
