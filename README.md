## üöÄ Features

`AI-Agent-2.0` comes packed with features designed to make building and deploying AI agents efficient and effective:

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Define high-level goals, and the agent intelligently breaks them down into executable sub-tasks.
*   **Multi-Step Reasoning & Planning:** Leverages advanced AI models (e.g., LLMs via API) for dynamic planning and decision-making throughout a task's lifecycle.
*   **Pluggable Tool & API Integration:** Easily define and integrate custom "tools" (JavaScript functions) that allow the agent to interact with external APIs, databases, or local systems.
*   **Context & Memory Management:** Supports various memory implementations to maintain conversational context, store learned information, and track long-term goals.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy swapping of AI models, toolsets, and memory providers.
*   **Event-Driven System:** Emits events at key stages of its operation (e.g., plan generated, tool executed, task completed) for real-time monitoring and custom reactions.
*   **Configurable Persistence:** Options for storing agent state and memories across sessions, ensuring continuity and reliability.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Built-in mechanisms to gracefully handle failures during task execution and provide actionable insights.
*   **Developer-Friendly API:** Simple and intuitive JavaScript API for defining agents, tasks, and tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get `AI-Agent-2.0` up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended, e.g., 18.x or 20.x)
*   npm or Yarn package manager

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    `AI-Agent-2.0` requires API keys for the AI models it interacts with (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

    ```ini
    # Example for OpenAI
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here
    # Add other API keys as needed (e.g., ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY)

    # Optional: Configure the default AI model to use
    DEFAULT_AI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
    ```

    *Make sure to replace `sk-your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key.*

## üí° Usage

Once installed and configured, you can start using `AI-Agent-2.0` to define and execute autonomous tasks.

### 1. Basic Agent Initialization

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `agent.js`) and initialize the agent:

```javascript
// agent.js
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables

const { Agent } = require('./src/Agent'); // Assuming Agent class is in src/Agent.js
const { ConsoleLogger } = require('./src/utils/ConsoleLogger'); // Example logger
const { InMemoryMemory } = require('./src/memory/InMemoryMemory'); // Example memory

async function main() {
    const agent = new Agent({
        model: process.env.DEFAULT_AI_MODEL || 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // Or directly 'gpt-4'
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Or other relevant API key env var
        logger: new ConsoleLogger(),
        memory: new InMemoryMemory(),
        // Add other configurations like tool registry, etc.
    });

    console.log("AI-Agent-2.0 initialized successfully!");

    // You can now use the agent to perform tasks
    // await agent.executeTask("Your goal here");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### 2. Defining a Task and Executing

To make the agent perform a task, use the `executeTask` method:

```javascript
// agent.js (continued)

// ... inside the main function ...

try {
    const taskGoal = "Research the latest trends in serverless computing and summarize key findings.";
    console.log(`\nAgent starting task: "${taskGoal}"`);

    const result = await agent.executeTask(taskGoal);

    console.log("\n--- Task Completed ---");
    console.log("Final Result:", result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("\n--- Task Failed ---");
    console.error("Error during execution:", error.message);
    if (error.details) {
        console.error("Details:", error.details);
    }
}
```

### 3. Running Your Agent

Execute your JavaScript file using Node.js:

```bash
node agent.js
```

Observe the agent's output in the console as it plans, executes steps, and provides a final result.

### 4. Customizing Tools

`AI-Agent-2.0` allows you to define custom tools that the agent can use. Tools are simply JavaScript functions that the agent can "call" based on its plan.

Example of a simple "Web Search" tool:

```javascript
// src/tools/WebSearchTool.js
class WebSearchTool {
    constructor() {
        this.name = "web_search";
        this.description = "Performs a web search for a given query and returns relevant results.";
        this.parameters = {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                query: {
                    type: "string",
                    description: "The search query."
                }
            },
            required: ["query"]
        };
    }

    async execute(query) {
        // In a real application, this would integrate with a search API (e.g., Google Custom Search, DuckDuckGo API)
        console.log(`[TOOL:web_search] Searching for: "${query}"`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Simulate API call delay
        if (query.includes("serverless trends")) {
            return `{"results": ["Trend 1: Edge Computing Integration", "Trend 2: FaaS Optimization", "Trend 3: Serverless Databases"]}`;
        }
        return `{"results": ["No specific results found for '${query}'."]}`;
    }
}

module.exports = { WebSearchTool };
```

To make the agent aware of this tool, you'd register it during agent initialization:

```javascript
// agent.js (continued, inside main function)
const { ToolRegistry } = require('./src/tools/ToolRegistry'); // Assuming ToolRegistry
const { WebSearchTool } = require('./src/tools/WebSearchTool');

// ... inside main() function, before agent initialization ...
const toolRegistry = new ToolRegistry();
toolRegistry.registerTool(new WebSearchTool());

const agent = new Agent({
    // ... existing configuration ...
    toolRegistry: toolRegistry, // Pass the tool registry to the agent
});
```

Now, when you ask the agent to "Research the latest trends...", it can potentially use the `web_search` tool if it determines it's necessary.
