## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a robust and highly extensible JavaScript framework designed for developing sophisticated intelligent agents. Building upon the foundational concepts of its predecessor, this 2.0 iteration significantly enhances modularity, introduces more advanced decision-making capabilities, and streamlines the process of integrating complex agent behaviors into your applications.

Whether you're looking to create advanced chatbots, intelligent automation systems, data analysis assistants, or complex simulation entities, AI-Agent-2.0 provides a flexible and powerful foundation to bring your autonomous agents to life within modern web and server-side environments (Node.js).

---

## Features

AI-Agent-2.0 comes packed with features designed to make agent development intuitive and powerful:

*   **Modular & Extensible Architecture:** Easily define and integrate new functionalities, sensors, effectors, or AI models through a clear, plugin-based system.
*   **Dynamic Decision-Making Core:** Leverage sophisticated AI modules (e.g., rule-based, state-machine, or learning-based) to enable agents to make informed, context-aware decisions.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** Agents can react to internal and external stimuli asynchronously, ensuring responsive and efficient behavior.
*   **Robust State Management:** A built-in system for tracking the agent's internal state, memory, and environmental context provides a consistent source of truth.
*   **Task & Goal Management:** Define, prioritize, and execute complex sequences of actions to achieve overarching goals.
*   **Logger Integration:** Built-in, configurable logging for monitoring agent behavior, debugging complex interactions, and performance analysis.
*   **JavaScript Native:** Fully implemented in JavaScript, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and seamlessly compatible with Node.js environments.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Designed to be integrated into various applications, from command-line tools to backend services.

## Usage

This section provides examples of how to initialize and interact with an agent using AI-Agent-2.0.

### Basic Agent Example

Let's create a simple agent that greets and then says goodbye after a short delay.

Create a file named `myAgent.js` in the root of your project:

```javascript
// myAgent.js
import { Agent } from './src/core/Agent.js'; // Adjust path if your Agent class is structured differently

/**
 * A simple AI-Agent-2.0 example demonstrating basic event handling and task execution.
 */
async function runMyAgent() {
    // 1. Initialize a new agent
    const myAgent = new Agent('GreeterAgent');
    console.log(`Agent "${myAgent.name}" initialized.`);

    // 2. Define agent behaviors using event listeners
    myAgent.on('agent:start', async () => {
        console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] has started!`);
        // Emit a custom event
        myAgent.emit('greet:world', { message: 'Hello from AI-Agent-2.0!' });
    });

    myAgent.on('greet:world', async (payload) => {
        console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] received event: greet:world`);
        console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] Says: ${payload.message}`);

        // Register and execute a task after a delay
        await myAgent.executeTask(
            'sayGoodbye', // Task ID
            async () => { // Task function
                console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] Initiating goodbye sequence...`);
                // Simulate some work
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
                console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] Goodbye for now!`);
                myAgent.emit('agent:stop'); // Signal agent to stop
            },
            { delay: 2000 } // Options: execute after 2 seconds
        );
    });

    myAgent.on('agent:stop', () => {
        console.log(`[${myAgent.name}] is shutting down.`);
        myAgent.stop(); // Properly stop the agent instance
    });

    // 3. Start the agent
    myAgent.start();
}

// Execute the agent
runMyAgent();
```

### Running the Example

To run the `myAgent.js` example, execute the following command in your terminal from the project root:

```bash
node myAgent.js
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Agent "GreeterAgent" initialized.
[GreeterAgent] has started!
[GreeterAgent] received event: greet:world
[GreeterAgent] Says: Hello from AI-Agent-2.0!
[GreeterAgent] Initiating goodbye sequence...
[GreeterAgent] Goodbye for now!
[GreeterAgent] is shutting down.
```

This example demonstrates the basic lifecycle of an agent: initialization, event emission/handling, task execution, and graceful shutdown.
