## Description

**AI-Agent-2.0** is a robust, next-generation framework designed to empower developers in building sophisticated, autonomous AI agents. Building upon the principles of intelligent decision-making and efficient task execution, this iteration provides enhanced modularity, scalability, and a more intuitive developer experience.

Crafted in JavaScript, AI-Agent-2.0 enables agents to perceive, reason, plan, and act within dynamic environments, making it ideal for a wide range of applications from automated workflows to complex simulations. Whether you're creating intelligent assistants, game AI, or system automation bots, AI-Agent-2.0 offers the foundational tools to bring your autonomous entities to life.

## Features

AI-Agent-2.0 comes packed with powerful features to facilitate the development of cutting-edge AI agents:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend and customize agent capabilities with a plugin-based system for perception, action, and memory modules.
*   **Advanced Decision Engine:** A flexible, configurable engine that allows agents to make intelligent choices based on their current state, goals, and environmental feedback.
*   **Asynchronous Task Management:** Efficiently handle multiple tasks and long-running operations without blocking the agent's core processes.
*   **Perception & Environment Interaction:** Robust mechanisms for agents to gather data from their environment and execute actions, fostering dynamic and reactive behavior.
*   **Memory & Learning Capabilities:** Built-in support for agents to store past experiences, learn from interactions, and adapt their strategies over time.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** A clean event-bus system for inter-agent communication and broadcasting environmental changes.
*   **Developer-Friendly API:** A well-documented, easy-to-use API designed to accelerate agent development and minimize boilerplate code.
*   **Scalable Design:** Engineered for performance, allowing for the deployment of multiple agents concurrently in various application contexts.

## Installation

To get AI-Agent-2.0 up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
*   npm or Yarn package manager

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUser/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Build the project (if applicable, for production use or type safety):**
    If your project uses TypeScript or requires a build step:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # OR
    yarn build
    ```

You are now ready to start creating your autonomous agents!

## Usage

AI-Agent-2.0 makes it straightforward to define and run intelligent agents. Below is a basic example demonstrating how to create a simple agent that performs a periodic task.

### Basic Agent Example (`myFirstAgent.js`)

```javascript
// Import the core Agent class (adjust path as necessary)
import { Agent } from './src/Agent.js'; // Assuming 'src/Agent.js' as the main export

// Define a simple agent class
class GreeterAgent extends Agent {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
        this.addGoal('Greet periodically'); // Agents can have goals
    }

    // Define agent's behavior (e.g., a perception cycle or task loop)
    async perceive() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is perceiving its environment...`);
        // In a real agent, this would gather data from external sources
    }

    async decide() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is deciding what to do...`);
        // Based on perception and goals, decide on an action
        if (this.hasGoal('Greet periodically')) {
            console.log(`${this.name} decides to greet!`);
            this.addAction('greet');
        }
    }

    async execute(action) {
        if (action === 'greet') {
            console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}! The time is ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${this.name} executed unknown action: ${action}`);
        }
        // Simulate some work
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }

    // Optional: Define lifecycle hooks
    onStart() {
        console.log(`${this.name} has started its operations.`);
        this.interval = setInterval(() => this.runCycle(), 5000); // Run cycle every 5 seconds
    }

    onStop() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is stopping.`);
        clearInterval(this.interval);
    }
}

// Instantiate and run the agent
async function main() {
    console.log("Starting AI-Agent-2.0 example...");
    const greeter = new GreeterAgent("GreeterBot");

    // Start the agent
    greeter.start();

    // Let it run for a bit, then stop it
    setTimeout(() => {
        greeter.stop();
        console.log("AI-Agent-2.0 example finished.");
    }, 20000); // Run for 20 seconds
}

main();
```

### Running the Example

1.  Save the code above as `myFirstAgent.js` in the root of your `AI-Agent-2.0` directory.
2.  Execute it using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node myFirstAgent.js
    ```

You should see your `GreeterBot` starting, perceiving, deciding, and greeting every 5 seconds before gracefully shutting down.

**Note:** Remember to replace `YourGitHubUser` with your actual GitHub username in the badges and `git clone` command. Also, the example code assumes a basic structure for `Agent.js` which you would need to implement in your actual project. The path `import { Agent } from './src/Agent.js';` is a placeholder and should reflect your project's actual module structure.
