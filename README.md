## Description

AI-Agent-2.0 is a robust and extensible JavaScript framework for building intelligent, autonomous agents. Designed with modularity and ease-of-use in mind, it empowers developers to create agents capable of perception, decision-making, and action in various environments. Whether you're building sophisticated chatbots, automation tools, or complex AI systems, AI-Agent-2.0 provides the foundational components and an intuitive API to bring your intelligent applications to life.

Leveraging the power of JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem, AI-Agent-2.0 is highly adaptable for both server-side applications and potentially browser-based intelligent systems. It's built to be the next generation of intelligent agent development, focusing on flexibility and performance.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily extendable with custom modules for different functionalities (e.g., perception, decision, action, memory).
*   **Event-Driven Core:** Agents react efficiently to internal states and external events from their environment.
*   **Pluggable Perception:** Seamlessly integrate various data sources, APIs, sensors, or internal states for comprehensive agent input.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making:** Support for diverse decision-making strategies, including rule-based logic, state machines, or integration with external machine learning models.
*   **Action Execution Engine:** Define and execute a wide range of actions within the agent's environment, with built-in concurrency management.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Built from the ground up to handle complex, non-blocking tasks efficiently, crucial for real-time agent responsiveness.
*   **JavaScript Native:** Full leverage of the JavaScript language and the extensive Node.js ecosystem for rich development possibilities.
*   **Open and Extensible API:** Intuitive and well-documented API designed for easy customization and integration into existing projects.

## Installation

To get AI-Agent-2.0 up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or the organization's name)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn to install the necessary packages.

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using yarn
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Ensure Node.js is installed:**
    AI-Agent-2.0 requires Node.js (v14 or higher is recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like `nvm`.
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to initialize and run a simple agent using AI-Agent-2.0. This demonstrates creating an agent with a custom module to perform a task.

Let's assume the core `Agent` class is exported from a main entry point, e.g., `ai-agent-2.0` if published as a package, or `./src/Agent` if used locally.

```javascript
// app.js

// Import the Agent class (adjust path if using local files)
const { Agent } = require('./src/Agent'); // Or `require('ai-agent-2.0')` if installed as a package

// Define a simple custom module that our agent can use
class TaskExecutorModule {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    async performSimpleTask(taskName, durationMs = 1000) {
        console.log(`[${this.name}] Initiating task: "${taskName}" for ${durationMs}ms...`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, durationMs));
        console.log(`[${this.name}] Task "${taskName}" completed.`);
        return `"${taskName}" finished successfully.`;
    }

    async reportStatus() {
        return `[${this.name}] Status: Ready to execute tasks.`;
    }
}

async function main() {
    // 1. Initialize our AI Agent
    const myAgent = new Agent({
        name: 'AlphaAgent',
        // Attach custom modules to the agent
        modules: {
            taskExecutor: new TaskExecutorModule('TaskExecutor')
        }
    });

    console.log(`Agent '${myAgent.name}' has been initialized.`);

    // 2. The agent can now use its attached modules
    try {
        // Have the agent perform a task
        const taskResult = await myAgent.modules.taskExecutor.performSimpleTask('Data Analysis', 2000);
        console.log(`Agent's report on Data Analysis: ${taskResult}`);

        // Get a status report from a module
        const statusReport = await myAgent.modules.taskExecutor.reportStatus();
        console.log(`Agent's module status: ${statusReport}`);

        // Simulate a decision-action cycle (conceptual, AI-Agent-2.0 would orchestrate this)
        console.log(`\nAgent '${myAgent.name}' enters a decision cycle...`);
        const perceivedInfo = { threatLevel: 'low', energyLevel: 80 }; // Example perception
        if (perceivedInfo.threatLevel === 'low' && perceivedInfo.energyLevel > 50) {
            console(`Agent decides to perform another task.`);
            const anotherTaskResult = await myAgent.modules.taskExecutor.performSimpleTask('System Check', 1500);
            console.log(`Agent's report on System Check: ${anotherTaskResult}`);
        } else {
            console(`Agent decides to conserve energy.`);
        }

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('An error occurred during agent operation:', error);
    }
}

// Run the main function
main().catch(console.error);
```

To run this example:

1.  Save the code above as `app.js` in the root of your `AI-Agent-2.0` directory.
2.  Make sure you have an `Agent.js` file in a `src/` directory (or wherever your `Agent` class is located). For a minimal `src/Agent.js`:
    ```javascript
    // src/Agent.js
    class Agent {
        constructor({ name, modules = {} }) {
            this.name = name;
            this.modules = modules; // Store attached modules
            console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" created.`);
        }
        // Additional methods for perception, decision, action would go here
    }
    module.exports = { Agent };
    ```
3.  Execute it from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

This output will demonstrate the agent initializing and utilizing its `taskExecutor` module to perform tasks.
