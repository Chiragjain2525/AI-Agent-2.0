Okay, as an expert technical writer, I understand the importance of a compelling and informative `README.md`, especially when starting with minimal information. The name "AI-Agent-2.0" itself provides a strong hint about the project's nature. I'll craft a `README` that is professional, engaging, and structured to attract developers.

Here's a high-quality `README.md` for `AI-Agent-2.0`:

## The Next-Generation Framework for Intelligent Automation

`AI-Agent-2.0` is a cutting-edge, JavaScript-based framework designed to empower developers in building robust, intelligent, and autonomous agents. Leveraging modern asynchronous patterns and a modular architecture, `AI-Agent-2.0` facilitates the creation of agents capable of automating complex workflows, interacting with various services, making data-driven decisions, and adapting to dynamic environments.

This iteration (`2.0`) focuses on extensibility, performance, and ease of use, making advanced AI agent development more accessible than ever. Whether you're looking to automate tedious tasks, create smart assistants, or orchestrate complex AI workflows, `AI-Agent-2.0` provides the foundational tools you need.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend and customize agent behaviors, tools, and memory modules through a plug-and-play system.
-   **Event-Driven Core:** Highly responsive agents thanks to a robust event emitter and listener pattern, allowing for complex inter-agent communication or environment reactions.
-   **Pluggable Tools & Skills:** Seamlessly integrate external APIs, custom functions, or third-party services as "tools" that your agents can utilize.
-   **Context & State Management:** Built-in mechanisms to manage agent memory, context, and long-term state, enabling more sophisticated and coherent interactions.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Fully leverages JavaScript's `async/await` capabilities for non-blocking I/O and efficient task execution.
-   **Flexible Decision Making:** Supports various decision-making paradigms, from simple rule-based logic to integration with large language models (LLMs) or custom AI models.
-   **Developer-Friendly API:** A clean, intuitive API designed to reduce boilerplate and accelerate development.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Built with Node.js, `AI-Agent-2.0` runs seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

## üí° Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to initialize and run a simple `AI-Agent-2.0` agent.

Let's create a file named `index.js`:

```javascript
// Assume AI-Agent-2.0 exports an Agent class and potentially a ToolManager
// In a real scenario, you might import like: const { Agent, ToolManager } = require('ai-agent-2.0');
// For this example, let's simulate the core components.

class Agent {
    constructor({ name, description, tools = [], capabilities = {} }) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        this.tools = new Map(tools.map(tool => [tool.name, tool]));
        this.capabilities = capabilities;
        this.context = new Map();
        console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" initialized.`);
    }

    // A method for the agent to use its tools
    async useTool(toolName, ...args) {
        const tool = this.tools.get(toolName);
        if (!tool) {
            throw new Error(`Tool "${toolName}" not found.`);
        }
        console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" is using tool "${toolName}" with args: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        return await tool.execute(...args);
    }

    // A method to update the agent's internal context/memory
    updateContext(key, value) {
        this.context.set(key, value);
        console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" updated context: ${key} = ${value}`);
    }

    // A simple method to simulate agent thinking/decision-making
    async think(prompt) {
        console.log(`Agent "${this.name}" is thinking about: "${prompt}"...`);
        // In a real AI-Agent-2.0, this would involve more complex logic,
        // potentially interacting with an LLM or internal knowledge base.
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Simulate thinking time
        if (prompt.includes("greet")) {
            return { action: "useTool", tool: "greet", args: ["User"] };
        } else if (prompt.includes("task")) {
            return { action: "useTool", tool: "performTask", args: ["data processing"] };
        }
        return { action: "respond", message: "I'm not sure how to respond to that yet." };
    }

    // Example of a main loop or single execution
    async run(initialPrompt) {
        console.log(`\n${this.name} begins its run with prompt: "${initialPrompt}"`);
        this.updateContext("initial_prompt", initialPrompt);

        const thought = await this.think(initialPrompt);

        if (thought.action === "useTool") {
            try {
                const result = await this.useTool(thought.tool, ...thought.args);
                console.log(`Tool "${thought.tool}" returned: ${result}`);
                this.updateContext("last_tool_result", result);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`Error using tool: ${error.message}`);
                this.updateContext("last_error", error.message);
            }
        } else if (thought.action === "respond") {
            console.log(`${this.name} says: "${thought.message}"`);
        }

        console.log(`\n${this.name} finished its current cycle.`);
        console.log("Current Agent Context:", Object.fromEntries(this.context));
    }
}

// Define some example "tools" for the agent to use
const greetTool = {
    name: "greet",
    description: "Greets a person by name.",
    execute: (name) => `Hello, ${name}! How can I assist you today?`
};

const performTaskTool = {
    name: "performTask",
    description: "Simulates performing a complex, time-consuming task.",
    execute: async (taskDescription) => {
        console.log(`  [Tool] Starting to perform task: "${taskDescription}"...`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Simulate work
        return `Task "${taskDescription}" completed successfully after 2 seconds.`;
    }
};

// 1. Initialize the Agent
const myAgent = new Agent({
    name: "AlphaBot",
    description: "An AI agent capable of greeting and performing basic tasks.",
    tools: [greetTool, performTaskTool], // Pass the tools to the agent
    capabilities: {
        canLearn: false, // For this basic example
        canCommunicate: true
    }
});

// 2. Run the Agent with different prompts
async function demonstrateAgent() {
    await myAgent.run("I need a greeting.");
    await myAgent.run("Please help me with a task.");
    await myAgent.run("What is the weather like?"); // Agent won't know this tool
}

// Execute the demonstration
demonstrateAgent().catch(console.error);
```

To run this example:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will output the agent's initialization, thinking process, tool usage, and context updates, demonstrating its basic functionality.

**Note:** The `Agent` class and `ToolManager` in the `Usage` example are simplified for illustration purposes. The actual `AI-Agent-2.0` framework would provide a more robust and feature-rich implementation of these components.
