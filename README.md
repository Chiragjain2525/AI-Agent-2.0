## üìù Description

_**AI-Agent-2.0 is an advanced, JavaScript-powered autonomous AI agent designed to revolutionize task automation.**_

AI-Agent-2.0 is an advanced, JavaScript-powered autonomous AI agent designed to revolutionize **task automation, intelligent decision-making, and content generation**. Building upon the foundational concepts of AI agents, version 2.0 introduces enhanced capabilities, improved performance, and a more modular architecture, making it an ideal solution for developers looking to integrate sophisticated AI behaviors into their applications.

Whether you're looking to automate complex workflows, build smart assistants, or explore the cutting edge of AI-driven autonomy, AI-Agent-2.0 provides a robust and flexible framework to bring your ideas to life.

## ‚ú® Features

AI-Agent-2.0 is built with extensibility and performance in mind, offering a range of powerful features:

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Ability to independently plan, execute, and adapt complex sequences of actions based on predefined goals or dynamic inputs.
*   **Modular & Extensible Core:** Designed for easy addition of new capabilities, tools, and integrations via a plugin-based system, allowing for endless customization.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making:** Leverages advanced AI models (e.g., LLMs, custom algorithms) for dynamic reasoning, problem-solving, and strategic planning.
*   **Robust Error Handling & Recovery:** Built-in mechanisms to gracefully manage and attempt recovery from unexpected scenarios during task execution.
*   **Customizable AI Prompts & Behaviors:** Easily tailor the agent's persona, goals, and operational strategies through configurable parameters.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Fully asynchronous design leveraging JavaScript's event loop for efficient handling of concurrent tasks and I/O operations.
*   **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with external APIs and tools (e.g., web search, code interpreters, file systems).
*   **Memory Management:** Sophisticated memory system for persistent learning and contextual understanding across tasks.
*   **Interactive Mode:** Option for human oversight and interaction during critical decision points.

## üöÄ Installation

To get AI-Agent-2.0 up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher (LTS recommended)
*   **npm** or **Yarn**: Comes with Node.js, or install Yarn separately.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-2.0.git
    ```
    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `AI-Agent-2.0` with your actual repository name if it differs.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd AI-Agent-2.0
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Configuration (Environment Variables):**
    AI-Agent-2.0 requires certain environment variables for API keys, settings, and other configurations.
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory based on the provided `.env.example`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and populate it with your specific values. Here's an example of what your `.env` might look like:

    ```ini
    # .env file example

    # --- REQUIRED ---
    # Your OpenAI API Key (or other LLM provider)
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

    # --- OPTIONAL ---
    # Set the primary goal for the AI agent
    AGENT_GOAL="Research the latest advancements in quantum computing and summarize findings."

    # Model to use (e.g., gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo)
    LLM_MODEL="gpt-4-turbo-preview"

    # Debug mode (true/false)
    DEBUG_MODE=true

    # [Add any other environment variables your project uses, e.g.,
    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, AGENT_NAME, MAX_ITERATIONS]
    ```
    **Remember to replace `"sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.**

## üí° Usage

Once installed and configured, you can start using AI-Agent-2.0 to execute tasks.

### Starting the Agent

To start the agent, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm start
```
Or, if you prefer to use Node directly:
```bash
node src/index.js # Or whatever your main entry file is, e.g., main.js
```

Upon execution, the agent will initialize, load its configuration, and begin executing its pre-defined tasks or reacting to input based on its design.

### Basic Interaction / Execution Flow

By default, the agent might:
*   Read its primary goal from the `AGENT_GOAL` environment variable or a configuration file.
*   Present a prompt for you to enter a goal/task in the console.
*   Begin an autonomous process, logging its steps and decisions to the console.

**Example Scenario: Running with a specific goal**

You can often pass arguments to the agent to override default goals or settings. (This depends on how your `src/index.js` handles arguments).

For example, if your `package.json` has a `start` script like `node src/index.js` and your script parses command line arguments:

```bash
npm start -- --goal "Draft a blog post about serverless architectures." --debug
```

This would instruct the agent to focus on the specified goal and run in debug mode.

### Further Exploration

*   **`src/` directory:** Explore the source code in the `src/` directory to understand the agent's architecture, available tools, and how tasks are defined.
*   **Configuration Files:** Look into any dedicated configuration files (e.g., `config.js`, `agent_config.json`) for advanced settings.
*   **`docs/` (if present):** If a `docs/` folder exists, it will contain more detailed guides on advanced usage, custom tool creation, and deployment.
